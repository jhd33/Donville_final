        Some student publications at universities around the country are becoming increasingly isolated from other news outlets. With a unique business model, perhaps these publications could be an answer to the problem of news deserts.

<p> College Park, Md. -- With local news organizations struggling across the United States, millions of Americans now live in “news deserts.” </p>
<p>
According to the Hussman School of Journalism and Media at the University of North Carolina, news deserts are defined as, “a community, either rural or urban, with limited access to the sort of credible and comprehensive news and information that feeds democracy at the grassroots level.”

      <p>
        According to the Hussman school’s 2020 reports, the United States has lost almost 2100 newspapers, including 70 daily papers since 2004. More than 200 counties across the country have no local news coverage, and almost two thirds of the counties across the country do not have a daily newspaper. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the challenges facing the news industry are the changing business models that make the traditional advertising model untenable. As consumers move online and their habits change, the traditional news model has failed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there is one class of publications who may prove to be slightly more resilient to these changes: student publications at post-secondary institutions. These publications vary in quality and comprehensiveness, but nearly every university around the country has one.

      <p> Most importantly, they have a different business model. Most student publications do not operate on a profit model, but rather they get their funding from student fees. This limits the scope of the opportunities they can pursue, but it also makes them more resilient to the economic changes that are squeezing other newsrooms. </p>

        Already, many student publications occupy prominent status in their towns and counties. Using county by county data from the Hussman school, an analysis of schools in the Big Ten conference shows that two schools don’t have a single daily publication in their county (Maryland and Michigan). 
      </p>

      <p>
        Between those two counties, not including the student population of the schools, that is 1.2 million people combined without a daily newspaper in their county.

      <p> Furthermore, five of the 14 schools in the conference are situated in counties with three or fewer publications. In Centre County Pennsylvania for example, the home of Penn State, there is one daily and zero weekly publications for a county with a population of approximately 160,000 people. It is easy to see how The Daily Collegian, Penn State’s Student Newspaper, is likely of significant importance to the local community. </p>

      <p>
         On a national scale, a review of each state’s flagship university and the county in which it resides provided some surprising results.In Tolland County Connecticut, the home of UCONN, there is neither a daily nor a weekly newspaper. In other words, the county is a news desert. </p>

        <p>

Fourteen flagship public institutions are in counties with one or zero total publications, with seven schools in counties that have no daily publication. These schools are not exactly intuitive, as they feature some of the more well-known, and well-funded schools on the list. The University of North Carolina Chapel Hill for example, has zero daily publications in Orange County, North Carolina, despite being a prestigious university and a national brand.

         But student publications are not just limited to flagship schools, and they can potentially play important roles in counties all over the country. 
      </p>
      <p>
        
Of course, student publications are not a catch-all solution to the problem of losing local news. For one, there are issues of independence with student publications, as they technically are funded by the schools themselves. However, the funding at most schools comes from the student activity fee, which is at least partially and, in some cases, fully allocated by student organizations. Still, it is fair to wonder whether these publications can truly be objective if they get their funding in any way from the university they cover.

The other issue is that these publications do not use fully trained journalists. Student journalists across the country take on sometimes massive stories with limited training, and they are bound to make mistakes. This is one of the challenges that student publications will have to navigate as they operate in increasing isolation from other news outlets. Without being able to offer competitive salaries, student publications also lose their best journalists with every graduating class, reducing the opportunity for institutional knowledge to build. 

      </p>

    <p>
      Despite these challenges, student publications have proven to be more resilient so far, and they suddenly occupy an increasingly important role in the many diverse communities they represent. Whether they rise to the occasion, or suffer the same fate as other news organizations remains to be seen, but student publications are set to play a legitimate and growing role in the changing landscape of local news.
